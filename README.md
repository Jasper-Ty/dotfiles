# Jasper's dotfiles


## Info

I run Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on my ThinkPad X13 Gen 2a

## Notes

- set a udev rule to chgrp and chmod /sys/class/backlight/amdgpu_bl0/backlight.
- had to do some stupid apparmor shit I don't remember how to do to get the redshift script working

## Todo

- add neovim files
- do some install scripts
- fix system tray bug, unresponsive?
- fix monitor udev rule and script
