# Alacritty config

I build Alacritty from source. I'm currently on 0.13.0.

Themes are from the [Alacritty themes repository](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty-theme).

## Notes

- Alacritty must be installed manually-- install is a little *too* involved to be scripted (varying dependencies, post install steps, ...)
